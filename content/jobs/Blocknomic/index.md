Worked on developing OpenTradingPlatform. This platformâ€™s aim is to allow users to trade on multiple exchanges through a single platform.

- As the first in-house tech hire, led a team of interns to drive the product from scratch to completion, including both frontend and backend and making key architectural decisions.
- Integrated with various public blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash etc leading to near real-time withdrawals and redemptions.
- Integrated with multiple partner exchanges to facilitate trades across them.
- Wrote design documents and interface specifications for partner integration, reducing the time to live for adding new partners.
- Built a distributed real-time data aggregation and analysis system, aggregating real time trade and trades across connected partner exchanges to provide a consolidated data view to the user.
