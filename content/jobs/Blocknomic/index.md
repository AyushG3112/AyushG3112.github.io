Worked on developing OpenTradingPlatform. This platformâ€™s aim is to allow users to trade on multiple exchanges through a single platform.

- As the first in house hire, I played an integral role in design and development of the application, while leading and mentoring a team of interns.
- Built the core data analysis engine for the system which aggregates data from all connected exchanges, to provide users a detailed view of their investments, and available assets, across exchanges, and helps them get the best price for their trade.
- Built the interface server between our system and connected exchanges to facilitate fast trades, while ensuring the ease of adding more exchanges in the future.
- Implemented CI/CD using AWS Services like CodeDeploy, EC2, S3 etc
- Built a system for interaction with various public blockchains, for wallet generation, deposits and withdrawals. Integrated with Amazon SQS to facilitate the same.
- Built secure APIs for use with our clients, while participating in code reviews and peer reviews, while maintaining a test coverage of 90%+.
- Led the initiative of converting and breaking down the HTML designed layout into Vue.js, and integrating them with our actual data sources and APIs.
