Tech Stack: Go, JAVA, Ruby, PostgreSQL, GCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, RabbitMQ

As a part of the GoPay Plus team, I was responsible to building and optimizing workflows to enable authentic Customer Identity Verification, and prevent fraudulant signups and verifications for across all products integrated with the Platform, while staying compliant with local regulations.

- Onboarded, mentored and led multiple new hires in the team.
- Created KT videos on different topics to help onboard new people to the tech stack and the product, allowing asynchronous onboarding. Post that, held synchronous discussions to clarify any doubts and questions, and get feelback regarding the onboarding.
- Onboarded multiple vendors for end-user Identity Verification with automatic vendor switching to increase signup rates as well as smoother user onboarding.
- Developed a system to identify computer extracted selfies to prevent fraud, leading to an **improvement in fraud detection rated by 3%**.
- Integrated with Business Intelligence and other external workflows using Kafka Pipelines, setting up DLQ/DQ with automated pagers to handle any failures.
- Currently leading an initiative to build an asynchronous state machine to manage application states and workflow through our system. In regards to the same:
  - Created an engineering RFC and presented it to a larger team.
  - I researched RabbitMQ, including standard and patterns, use cases, common pitfalls and solutions to those. Held internal meetings and discussions to convey learnings to the team.
  - Implemeted a common JAVA RabbitMQ client which can be used by any project which wants to use rabbitMQ based on the decided usage patterns.
  - Designed a retry and fallback mechanism with exponential backoff to handle any erroneous cases for 100% relability.
