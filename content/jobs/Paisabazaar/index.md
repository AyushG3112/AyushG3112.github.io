Worked on developing the Paisabazaar Mutual Fund Investment Platform. This platformâ€™s aim is to allow users to seamlessly invest into various mutual funds, both unassisted, and with the help of an agent, and manage their investments.
 
- Drove the ground-up rework of the new mutual funds platform from conception to production while helping build the architecture from scratch, including making key High-Level and Low-Level decisions.
- Collaborated with different stakeholders and teams including Product, Business and Operations to understand the current bottlenecks in the process and top user complaints.
- Created plans to automate previously manual tasks and optimized major problematic workflows based on feedback and requirements collected from stakeholders.
- Led the migration of an active user base of over 200,000 active users, creating action and rollback, and fallback plans.
