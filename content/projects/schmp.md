`schmp` is an open source schema comparison tool, which allows you to compare schemas of data in JSON, YAML and TOML format.

The motivation to develop schmp arose as a requirement in our release process, to autoverify whether our config structure matches, in schema, not values, to our development or example configuration file.

- Developed a CLI using Go and published it.
- Achieved 90%+ code coverage with unit test cases.
- Implemented CI/CD using git tags and travis CI
